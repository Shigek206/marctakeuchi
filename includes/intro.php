						<p>I'm a customer driven IT specialist with 15+ years experience in Web UI/UX design and development. Experience providing support in all aspects of the system development lifecycle excelling at the development of requirements/functional/business analysis and design. I've had the opportunity to work in large and small companies spending the bulk of my career in Information Technology at Boeing while also volunteering at small startups during the dot com boom. I work at the Seattle web design agency <a href="http://www.seattlewebdesign.com" title="Seattle Web Design">efelle creative</a> and as of recent have entered the realm of online marketing and account management. I'm excited in creating partnerships and working with new and existing clients. Outside of work I'm a bonafied gym junkie, foodie and connoisseur of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marctakeuchi/" target="_blank">craft beers</a>.</p>
						<p>This is version 5.0 which was first launched back in 1999. Bamboo Digital comes from the Japanese/Hawaii culture combined with my passion for digital media design and technology. The original purpose of the site was to showcase my work in graphic and web design, however now it's all about simplicity and a place where folks can <a href="about" title="Learn more about Marc Takeuchi">learn more about me</a>.</p>
