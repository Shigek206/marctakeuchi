						 <p>Create partnerships with new clients by analyzing current website needs and requirement to help boost their online presence. Engage, collaborate and develop recommendations to help improve overall design, user experience and content optimization. Work with the client, account managers, web designers and developers making sure requirements and expectations remain in sync throughout the project lifecycle.</p> 

        				<p>My other responsibilities include assisting the sales team with writing proposals and presentation. Create and send out marketing campaigns showcasing new services, company news and system upgrades as well as important trends and changes in SEO to keep current clients informed while attracting new ones.</p>

        				<p>Update (04.01.17) - I'm back! On top of my consulting duties, I'm also helping the production team with front-end development. As they say, you can take the kid out of dev, but you can't take the dev out of the kid. To be honest, I'm having a blast being able to meet with clients while keeping my hands dirty in code. Best of both worlds!</p>
